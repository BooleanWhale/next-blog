                Hi, my name is Ashley Saleem-West. I'm a web developer with a background in design, based in St Albans (a wonderful town near London in the UK). I currently work at Underwaterpistol as a member of the web development team. I work with SCSS, HTML, JS and Liquid to develop bespoke Shopify Plus stores.
                </p>
                <p>
                Starting as a designer and becoming acquainted with web development through personal E-Commerce projects, I moved onto E-Service Europe Ltd to redesign and develop their E-Commerce website.
                </p>

                With experience in SQL databases and React.JS, I am always pushing myself to learn more in my spare time. Iâ€™ve worked on personal projects to become familiar with Libraries and frameworks that personally interest me, including Next.js and Tailwind CSS. I also like to keep up with the best practices for CSS and achieve greater performance and security by relying on pure CSS for user interactions and animations.
                </p>
                <p>When I'm not coding or designing, I can be found drawing or caring for my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jaqenclownfish/">two adorable clownfish.</a></p>
